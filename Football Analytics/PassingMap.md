This Visualization was made after analyzing statsbomb events data for passes in R and then visualizing the results in Tableau.
We can see the passing map for any given player for any given match in any competition. It can be great for analyzing the positions a player takes before making those key passes. It can also be used to see where a player recieves all the passes in a given match. We can also see the interlink between 2 players in a match by setting the player & receiver and see where the 2 players exchanged all their passes
